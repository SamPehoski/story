First Paragraph:
There once was a baseball team named the Minnesota Twins. They were playing on a brisk fall day
against the Houston Astros. The score was 1 to 1 in the bottom of the 7th. The twins are up to bat 
with their star player, Buron Buxton. The bases are loaded with two outs. 

Middle:(Sam Pehoski) The fans were ecstatic, as Buxton was considered an absoloute legend
by the entirety of the fanbase. "What a guy, what a hunk of a man. I would like him to be on MY baseball team!!",
they called out in perfect synchronization. Buxton stepped up to bat as overwhelming cheers of "Buron-Buron, He's my Huron!!!"
filled the stands. The crowd held ttheir breath as the pitcher wound up. Even though this was the seventh inning they were
still extremely pumped to see Buxton hit a homer.

End:
